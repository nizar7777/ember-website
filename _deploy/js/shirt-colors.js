/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Shared shirt colour + mockup definitions.

   The store doesn't hold photos of finished shirts. It holds your DESIGN
   artwork (one image per product, in the Google Sheet's Image column) and
   lays it over these shirt mockups at display time. That means one
   artwork file covers every colour — you never re-shoot or re-export a
   product photo per colour.

   Which colours a given design is offered in comes from that product's
   "Colors" cell in the sheet. Write them comma-separated, e.g.
       Black, White, Woody Green
   Matching is forgiving about case, spacing and word order, and a few
   older/shorter spellings still resolve (see `aliases`), so "green"
   and "Woody Green" both land on the same mockup.

   Load this file BEFORE js/store-products.js and js/order-entry.js.

  // As of 2 Aug 2026, 6 of 7 colours are hosted on the public S3 bucket
  // (ember-products, eu-north-1, mockup/ prefix) instead of shipping in
  // this repo — confirmed live by fetching each URL directly. This also
  // fixes a real bug: build-deploy.ps1 only ships mockup/*.webp to
  // production, and black/green/peach never had .webp versions, so those
  // three colours were completely broken on any deployed build.
  //
  // CAVEAT: the bucket currently only has the original 2402x3481 PNG
  // masters (2-3.7 MB each), not the optimized .webp (~50KB each) that
  // tools/convert-mockups.html used to generate locally. This fixes
  // correctness but not load time — if you upload .webp versions at the
  // same path with a .webp extension, flip the extensions below and every
  // product card gets noticeably lighter.
  // Bucket mockups were bulk-converted to WebP on 26 Aug 2026 (94% smaller
  // overall) via a one-off script; originals are still in the bucket under
  // .png but nothing reads them any more.
